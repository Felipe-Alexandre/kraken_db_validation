# Kraken Database Validation
This is the github page for the scripts, inputs and outputs of our custom database validation

As we have performed a customization of kraken2 database, we have to test if our additions have
significant impacts in classifing metagenomic sequences and in the recovery of microbial richness and taxonomic structure.

To do so, we have elaborated the scripts present in this git.

Please, feel free to make suggestions or ask for questions.
